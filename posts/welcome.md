Back in 2018 I started Indiedevcasts and I wanted to make games for a living. Guess what? I failed.

I will definitely continue this blog post soon, but waiting for the content you can already check my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiP0X6eFEg8) where I explain the history of Indiedevcasts and what I plan to do now.
